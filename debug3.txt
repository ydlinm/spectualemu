Role: Computational Imaging EngineerTask: CRITICAL BUG FIX for Step 3 (Prism Dispersion).Issue: The previous simulation resulted in ZERO DISPERSION. The spectral spread was only 0.5 pixels, which is physically useless.Requirements for V2:Switch Glass Material:Stop using N-BK7. It has almost no dispersion in NIR.Use SF11 (Dense Flint Glass).Cauchy Equation for SF11: $n(\lambda) \approx 1.74 + \frac{0.013}{\lambda^2}$ (Approximation, or use a proper look-up from RefractiveIndex.info for SF11 in 0.9-1.7um range). The refractive index change $\Delta n$ should be significant (e.g., ~0.02-0.03).Recalculate Dispersion Shift (Force Check):Formula: $\Delta x_{pixels} = \frac{f \cdot (n(\lambda) - n_{center}) \cdot \sin(\alpha)}{p}$Parameters:$f = 50 mm$ (Imaging lens focal length).$\alpha = 30^\circ$ (Prism apex).$p = 0.015 mm$ (Pixel size).Sanity Check Constraint: The total shift range from 900nm to 1700nm MUST be at least 50 to 100 pixels. If calculation < 50 pixels, check units or multiply by a gain factor.Print the min/max shift in pixels to console.Increase Exposure:Increase exposure time (e.g., from 1ms to 5ms - 10ms).Goal: The center of the brightest spots (Surface Reflection) MUST reach 4095 ADU (Saturation). Saturation ratio should be > 0.1%.Visualization Check:The output image MUST show elongated horizontal streaks, not dots.The cross-section profile MUST show a flat/sloped plateau corresponding to the spectrum, with a visible DIP at the 1450nm position.Re-run and generate reports.
